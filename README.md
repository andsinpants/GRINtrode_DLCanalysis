Code and data from GRINtrode Paper see McCullough et al., 2022, 

Dependent Function:
DJCS_padCells.m

Main Script:

DLC_output:
.h5 (tracking) and .csv (pose_estimation coordinates, likelihood scores) files from each of the GRINtrode videos outputed by DLC

MAT_files:
.mat outputs from AKM_getfreemousemove.m MATLAB script

Script outputs the x and y position, velocity, and acceleration of 5 effectors from DLC outputs on a resnet_50 network trained on 5 videos.
